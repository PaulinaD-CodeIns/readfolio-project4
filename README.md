# Readfolio

"Where your books come alive."

A web app for users to track their personal reading library. Users can add books, set reading status (To Read, Reading, Finished), update or delete entries. Users can also write their own reviews on their books or browse through public reviews

## Project Rationale

In a digital world with endless distractions, many avid readers seek a dedicated space to track their reading journey, document reflections, and share thoughts on books they love. While platforms like Goodreads offer social discovery, they can often feel impersonal or cluttered. Readfolio provides a focused, personal, and user-friendly space to manage your own library and reflect on what you read.

## Target Audience

- Avid readers looking to organize and track their reading journey
- Book club members who want to reflect on shared reads
- Casual readers who want a clean interface for managing book lists
- Individuals who prefer a private reading journal over a public social feed
